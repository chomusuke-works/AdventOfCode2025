# Advent of Code 2025

This is the first time I take part in the Advent of Code challenge, which can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com).

I decided to make it an occasion to learn about new programming languages. For this reason, I will use different languages throughout the challenge. In addition to some known ones, I will add some that are still foreign to me.

Here are the languages that I would like to use:
- Kotlin*
- Rust*
- Go*
- TypeScript*
- C#*
- Ruby*
- Python
- C
- Swift
- Java

New programming languages are marked by an asterisk (*).
